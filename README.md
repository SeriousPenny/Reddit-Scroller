# Reddit Scroller
This is a small Chrome Extension which you can use to scroll down to the next Reddit post automatically. You set the time you want to see each post, click the button, and off you go!

This is the first Chrome Extension I've ever made, so expect to see bugs :)
I'll try my best to keep it updated and (in case this is ever used by someone who's not a friend of mine), listen to feedback and fix bugs.

You can find the extension here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-scroller/obbeaiiaplojgmllajpdcgbblmgdmjnf

Thanks to two friends of mine for helping me with HTML&CSS and the app icons, respectively.
